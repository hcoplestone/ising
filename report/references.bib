@book{montecarlo,
	Abstract = {Monte Carlo methods have been very prominent in computer simulation of various systems in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. This book focuses on the discussion and path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods in many-body physics and provides a concise but complete introduction to the Metropolis algorithm and its applications in these two techniques. To explore the schemes in clarity, several quantum many-body systems are analysed and studied in detail. The book includes exercises to help digest the materials covered. It can be used as a tutorial to learn the discussion and path-integral Monte Carlo or a recipe for developing new research in the reader's own area. Two complete Java programs, one for the discussion Monte Carlo of 4He clusters on a graphite surface and the other for the path-integral Monte Carlo of cold atoms in a potential trap, are ready for download and adoption.},

@book{statmech,
	Abstract = {Foundations of Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics details the theoretical foundation the supports the concepts in classical and quantum statistical mechanics. The title discusses the various problems set by the theoretical justification of statistical mechanics methods. The text first covers the the ergodic theory in classical statistical mechanics, and then proceeds to tackling quantum mechanical ensembles. Next, the selection discusses the the ergodic theorem in quantum statistical mechanics and probability quantum ergodic theorems. The selection also details H-theorems and kinetic},
