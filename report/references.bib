	Abstract = {Foundations of Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics details the theoretical foundation the supports the concepts in classical and quantum statistical mechanics. The title discusses the various problems set by the theoretical justification of statistical mechanics methods. The text first covers the the ergodic theory in classical statistical mechanics, and then proceeds to tackling quantum mechanical ensembles. Next, the selection discusses the the ergodic theorem in quantum statistical mechanics and probability quantum ergodic theorems. The selection also details H-theorems and kinetic},
